Freemap SRTM Data
=================

The scripts in this directory can:
    - download SRTM elevation data from NASA's servers
    - reproject it into the Google style mercator projection
    - create shapefiles containing contour line versions of the data
    - create geotiffs containing hillshade versions of the data
    - create sql files that can be used to upload the contour data into a
      	     postgresql database.
    - upload the sql contour data into the a postgresql/postgis database.

The data processing is separated from the database upload, as this may 
be done on two different machines.

The data processing is done using makeContours.py.  This puts its output data
in a ./data directory.  Note that it is hard coded for the uk bounding box - change the 'll' variable to change the area to be processed.

Upload is done using upload_contours.sh.

Note that these are very crude, so may fail if your database setup is different
to mine etc.....


Any trouble, contact grahamjones139@gmail.com.
